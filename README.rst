What is elective?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``elective`` is a Python program configuration option loader, capable
of loading options from configuration files (TOML, JSON, YAML), the
environment, or the command line, all with the same names and formats.
There are many other fine options available, but none offered this
combination of formats, configurable precedence, clear code and
documentation, or adequate testing.  Most also still use the ini
format, which ``elective`` will not.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

* Implement basic TOML configuration loading from ``pyproject.toml`` (bring in from ``pccc``, target:  0.2.0).
* Consolidate TOML, JSON, and YAML loading (target:  0.2.0).
* Add ``argparser`` (target:  0.4.0).
* Implement and add environment variable processing (target:  0.5.0).
* Implement and add ``*.env`` file processing (target:  0.6.0).
* Implement testing, build, documentation, and CI (complete:  0.1.0).
